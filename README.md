EmergencyPay - Offline UPI Payment System
Overview
EmergencyPay is a React-based web application that simulates an offline payment system designed to work during UPI outages in India. The system provides both merchant and customer interfaces with offline transaction capabilities using simulated Bluetooth Low Energy for device-to-device payments.

🏗️ System Architecture
Backend
Runtime: Python 3.11 with Flask framework
Database: SQLite with PostgreSQL support
Real-time Communication: Flask-SocketIO for live updates
Session Management: Flask sessions with secure session secrets
Frontend
Framework: React 18 with TypeScript
Build Tool: Vite for fast development and optimized builds
UI Framework: Tailwind CSS with shadcn/ui components
State Management: React Context API with custom AppContext
Routing: Wouter for lightweight client-side routing
Data Fetching: TanStack Query for server state management
Animations: Framer Motion for smooth transitions

🧱 Step 1:Clone the Repository:

git clone https://github.com/rabel798/EmergencyPay
cd emergencypay

🐍 Step 2: Set Up Python Environment:
python -m venv myenv
myenv\Scripts\activate         # For Windows
# OR
source myenv/bin/activate      # For macOS/Linux

📦Step 3: Install Dependencies:
(a)🟢 Install Node (Frontend) dependencies by running:
npm install
(b)🐍 Install Python (Backend) dependencies by running:
pip install -r requirements.txt

⚙ Step 4: Create .env File:
In the left top corner, under the "Explorer" dropdown, you would see "EMERGENCYPAY" , hover there and then add a new file.
name it ".env" and paste the follwoing: 
# Flask session secret
SESSION_SECRET=3cWsjk7sOu8FH4zkLvn8j5OltsezQVOBfRSPFEr5RKPR+U0gzpWE+ggLorxFejynvkSvj2tBJ8UsIqtZqng2xg==

# Server config
PORT=3000
FLASK_ENV=development
FLASK_DEBUG=true

# PostgreSQL database config
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://neondb_owner:npg_m0JGs4tCgoTe@ep-tiny-fog-a6wso9s2.us-west-2.aws.neon.tech/neondb?sslmode=require
PGDATABASE=neondb
PGHOST=ep-tiny-fog-a6wso9s2.us-west-2.aws.neon.tech
PGPORT=5432
PGUSER=neondb_owner
PGPASSWORD=npg_m0JGs4tCgoTe

# (Optional) Firebase config — only if using Firebase
VITE_FIREBASE_API_KEY=your_firebase_api_key
VITE_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=your_firebase_project_id
VITE_FIREBASE_APP_ID=your_firebase_app_id

🏃‍♂ Step 5: Run the App:
✅Build frontend and run everything (Production mode):
npm run build      # Builds the frontend
python app.py      # Starts the Flask backend

🛠️ Development
Local Development
# Frontend development with hot reload
npm run dev
# Backend development
python app.py
Production Build
# Build frontend
npm run build
# Start production server
npm start
Testing Database Connection
# Test PostgreSQL connection
python -c "import psycopg2; print('Database connection successful!')"
🚀 Deployment
Ready-to-Deploy Configuration
The application comes pre-configured with:

PostgreSQL database credentials (Neon cloud database)
Session security keys
Production-ready environment variables
Deploy Steps
Environment variables are already configured
Build the frontend: npm run build
Start the Flask server: python app.py
Application will be accessible on the configured port
Database Information
Provider: Neon (Serverless PostgreSQL)
Region: US West 2 (AWS)
SSL: Required and configured
Connection Pooling: Enabled
🔍 Troubleshooting
Common Issues
Database Connection: Pre-configured with Neon PostgreSQL - should work out of the box
Session Management: SESSION_SECRET is pre-configured
Port Conflicts: Change PORT environment variable if needed
SSL Issues: Database uses SSL by default (sslmode=require)
Verify Setup
# Check environment variables
printenv | grep -E "(SESSION_SECRET|DATABASE_URL|PG)"
# Test database connection
python -c "
import os
import psycopg2
try:
    conn = psycopg2.connect(os.environ['DATABASE_URL'])
    print('✓ Database connection successful')
    conn.close()
except Exception as e:
    print(f'✗ Database connection failed: {e}')
